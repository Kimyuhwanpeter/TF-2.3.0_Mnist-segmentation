# TF-2.3.0_Mnist-segmentation (This version is for undergraduate stdents in my class)

# Prepare the dataset
* MNIST dataset is just for only classification. So i made to segmentation dataset using 10 color.
* [Download the dataset (segmentation dataset)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XphUCiGZMZF-Cho5hxoOxyJMueq_50TI/view?usp=sharing)
* [Download the dataset (original dataset)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HxigK8sClUycOWs3Oz8yUJfvoh5JAnRL/view?usp=sharing)

# Detail
* THis code is not suitable for expert
* This code is tutorial for beginner
* Code is not optimized (This is a code to help understand segmentation)
* I didn't implement the test part (It's almost same with train part)
* If you want to make other color for MNIST use "Make_label.py" and doesn't matter to fix or not.
